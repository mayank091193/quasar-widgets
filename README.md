## About The Project

Free library of great widgets to handle specific requirements in a n effective manner. Instant integration, fully responsive and supports all major browsers!

Here's why:
* Just install, integrate by giving the type and few other required attributes and that's it.
* Fully responsive on all resolutions
* Supports all major browsers
* Fully customizable

Of course, it may not contain the widget you are looking for, but it will be there eventually. Just request feature and I'll try my best to have it integrated in future version.
